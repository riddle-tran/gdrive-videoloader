# GDrive VideoLoader

**GDrive VideoLoader** is a Python-based tool to download videos from Google Drive effortlessly, **including those marked as _view-only_** (no download option). It supports resumable downloads, progress bars, parallel downloading, and various customization options for video fetching and downloading.

## Features

- Download videos even if marked as *view-only* (without a download button)
- Supports resumable downloads (continue from where it stopped)
- Supports parallel downloading of a single file (multithreading)
- Displays a progress bar for ongoing downloads
- Allows custom chunk sizes for downloading
- Optionally specify a custom output file name
- Verbose mode for detailed logs during execution

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Pip (Python package manager)

### Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Basic Command

To download a video, you can provide either the Google Drive file ID or a full Google Drive URL:

**Using a file ID:**
```bash
python gdrive_videoloader.py <video_id>
```

**Using a full Google Drive URL:**
```bash
python gdrive_videoloader.py https://drive.google.com/file/d/<video_id>/view
```

The script will automatically extract the file ID from the URL if you provide a full link.
